*Details*
The main interface is a map of NYC with an accordion menu overlayed on it. The menu items under "Filters" are categories that reveal filters when hovering over them. When a filter is toggled, queries are sent to the datasets, currently hosted on Parse.com and Socrata Open Data. The results will appear on the map, and you can view a list of results by opening the "Results" section in the accordion. A report is printable when you click on the print button, way to the bottom right.
